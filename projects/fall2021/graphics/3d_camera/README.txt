Assignment 5: Introduction to 3D
Author: Tyler Johnston

I chose to go the parametric curve route for this assignment. I went with a perspective
projection. I tinkered with the Up Vector so that the camera rotates in an interesting
pattern. 

I at one point had wanted to do a piecewise parametric curve, but I couldn't figure out 
how to make the endpoints connect.

With respect to this being late, while I'd appreciate mercy (as this is my first and
hopefully only late submission), I understand if I'm docked a point. CS571 has been
destroying my time management lately.
