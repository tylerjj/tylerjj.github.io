Homework 7: WebGL

So I relied pretty heavily on the class examples.
Primary thing I had to figure out for myself was hard-coding the
vertex data. That was alot of trial and error, seeing how things looked.
VertexPos, TriangleIndices, VertexColors, VertexNormals were all a decent time sink.

With respect to lighting, I relied pretty heavily on the framework of class
examples, my primary work here involved changing the knobs to achieve a lighting result I liked.

I also added a texture in order to make sure I got that experience before the class ended. 
Again, I relied pretty heavily on clsas examples as a template for how to implement a texture.

Was an interesting course this semester. Thanks for putting the time into staffing it.
Hope you have a great Christmas break!
