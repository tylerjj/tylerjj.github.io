Homework 4: Curves
Author: Tyler Johnston

My HW 4 is heavily reliant upon the groundwork setup in Week6: Demo 0. 
I added a third curve to our piecewise function and closed the loop.
I added animation of the objects that are drawn along the respective curve trajectories.
I utilized Hermite Cubics to attain C1 continuity. 

The nested closed-loop curves were my attempt to add a small amount of flavor. I'm not going for a 4 here.

Thanks,
Tyler
