For my animation I decided to *draw* a Nintendo character (Kirby) 
jumping up and down.

I believe there were only two pieces of code I heavily referenced.

https://github.com/sifakis/CS559F21_Demos/blob/main/Week2/Demo1/demo.js
I used this to get an example of how to set up the canvas in HTML and start
the app.js file.

I used this to learn how to draw a circle (what I used for the body.)
I then used this same procedure for the rest of my draw functions, 
replacing the arc function with an ellipsis or rect function depending on the need.
